# Technologies

To compile and run the project, you need to have the following installed:
- Java 17 - https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/#java17
- Maven 4.0.0 - https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi

To be sure, these are the specific versions we used. We cannot guarantee that the project will work with other versions.

# Compile

    mvn clean compile

# Run

To run the project, run the following command in the root directory of the project:

Where &lt;command&gt; is one of the following:
- *server* - Starts the server and takes no arguments Eg.:`server`
- *put* - Starts a publisher with id [arg3] and publishes the message [arg2] to the topic [arg1] Eg.: `put Music loveIt 0`

And &lt;command&gt; is a collection of 0, 2 or 3 arguments, dependent of the command required.
